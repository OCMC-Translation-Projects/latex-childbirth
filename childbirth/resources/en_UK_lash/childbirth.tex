O God, the Father Almighty, through the clear proclamation of your Prophet Isaiah you foretold to us the incarnation from a Virgin of your only-begotten Son and our God. In the last times by your own choice and with the cooperation of the Holy Spirit, in your endless compassion, you consented to become an infant from her, for the salvation of us mortals. In accordance with the custom of your holy law, after the completion of the days of purification, you consented, being yourself the true law-giver, to be brought to the Temple, and you submitted to be held in the arms of the righteous Symeon. This mystery was prefigured and made manifest to us in the vision of the Prophet Isaiah through the burning coal carried with tongs, and this same mystery we the faithful imitate by grace. And now do you, the same Lord who guard the infants, bless this child (these children) together with his

Glory to you, O God our hope, glory to you. May Christ, our true God, who submitted to be held in the arms of the righteous Symeon for our salvation, through the intercessions of his most pure and undefiled holy Mother; through the power of the precious and life-giving Cross; through the protection of the honorable bodiless powers in heaven; through the prayers of the honorable and glorious Prophet and Forerunner John the Baptist, of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, of the holy, glorious and victorious Martyrs, of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers, of the holy and righteous ancestors of the Lord God Joachim and Anna, and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us for he is a good and merciful God who loves mankind.
